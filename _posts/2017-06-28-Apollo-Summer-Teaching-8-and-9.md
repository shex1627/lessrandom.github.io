# Tuesday

## Recap  
1.first guiding Andy through a small mistake that he made, spending around 8-15min on that. Then he finally sees
his mistake.  
2.Eason gets so many problems wrong because he doesn't read the question.
3.Netsa reads my book mathematical mindsets 

## Debate
I often get annoyed by the fact that my students are too lazy to:
	1.double check the answers they come up with 
	2.spend enough time to double check why they get an answer wrong
	3.spend enough time to explore the right answer


## Purpose of My Teaching 
To level up, I have to rework my contempt toward others’ “flaws”(which I do share a whole lot).  I should treat the kids at Apollo like the customers of my education institution. 

It is not going to be easy. I can’t just stop being a hater all of a sudden but I need to constantly remind myself when I make a mistake. 

# Wednesday  
## Recap  
1.Amy is being much more polite and receptive; while Netsa doesn’t even want to talk me to anymore for some reason(say I am being too rude). I am surprised to see two different responses from my teachings.  
2.Andy is still asking me the new questions. I can’t understand his fear because I already know the answer but I do expect him to try at least for sometime before asking for help. 

## Reflection  
Sometimes teaching styles really matter. I think 3 years into teaching, I may converge to a teaching style that only suits a certain group of students but not others. Just like my friend Harrison comments the famous stat professor Ani is too hard for him(even though I know he is a brilliant enough to pass the class with a good grade.)
