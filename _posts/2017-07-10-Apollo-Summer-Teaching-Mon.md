# Monday
I was way too salty on Monday. That may due to  
1. lack of sleep  
2. too full  
3. the salt I was thinking in the bus
4. inability to deliver fast response to kids request  
5. the fact that I am leaving in a month   

## The procedural note book  
I am going to make some guides how to handle students' question requests before I leave this place.  
Students have to answer certain questions before asking me for help, such as "paraphrase the problem,"  
"write down the definition of relevant concepts," "write down other concepts you think may be useful."  
I think it will help students develop meta-cognition skills if they do put into the effort completing  
the card.
