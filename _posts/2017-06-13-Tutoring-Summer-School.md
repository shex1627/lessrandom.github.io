**Challenges that I face:**  
1.There is just so much negativity in the summer school.  
2.student J seems to rejecting my teaching of negative number and she is
repeating that she hated math.
3.student E doesn't really double checks his answers and most importantly he is
not following my advice to read the questions when he get confused.
4.it is very demoviating to do work. The kids are forced to go there.


**Some techniques that I used yesterday:**  
1.dont say "I don't know"  
the retarded clause(saying "I don't know"). The retarded clause means saying  
"don't ever (), otherwise I will automatically think you are retarded, and I
hate retarded people. I will refuse to help you until I don't think you are
retarded.  

**Some Important Things to Realize:**  
1.I am not going to change the atmosphere over night.  
2.I will get paid working there because I am one of the best tutor.   

**Brainstorming General Strategies:**  
1.create a better studying environment.  
2.create a system monitoring student's progress, hand write things   
3.use myself as a role model, working hard on my things.   
4.help demonstrate math makes sense and useful in life, even though it is hard.  

**Works to do on Tuesday Session:**  
the second point from above takes the highest priority.
