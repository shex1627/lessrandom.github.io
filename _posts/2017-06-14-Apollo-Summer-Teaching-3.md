### Overall  
1.I was consumed by my neck pain and back pain. I need to go back doing plank everyday at laest.	
2.I was also occupied by the book *How Children Succeed.*  
3.E doesn't want to be observed while he is doing his work. J couldn't finish her 
final test because it was difficult for her to concentrate and no motivation to 
finish it fast 

### Feedback on the Scoreboard Approach  
E: not used at all  
J: no noticeable difference  
Me: Working exceptionally well. I am aware of D's roast every time. My response are not
perfect but shows a good attempt. This could be extended to other areas of my life. I want 
to take it slow, start from places to places. First I just want to defend all the aggro I have 
at Apollo. Next time I should tell D that if he wants me to tutor him math at least he should pay me
some respect:   
"What is the point of going to collge if you don't know how to respect people, 
I guess you haven't taken a class about manners yet"   
**I should also keep in mind that my strategy to ignore those people because I don't want to waste time dealing with
them. But if they are intefereing my work, then I should take actions.** 

### How Children Succeed  
1.character strength  
2."They found that the students with the highest GPAs were the ones who scored the lowest on measures of creativity 
and independence, and the highest on measures of punctuality, delay of gratification, predictability, and dependability...
Corporate America's rulers wanted to staff their offices with bland and reliable sheep, so they created a school system 
that selected for those traits."   

### Under Such Constraint, What Could I do on Friday  
1.A general direction is to collect data on the problems that students encounter  
2.A procedural guide to effective tutoring  
3.**If I am observing how my student solves problems and if he/she doesn't like it,
try not to make it so obvious.**

### Fusion Between Me and My Teaching Style  
1.Incorporating the books that I have learned into my teaching and analysis
(How Learning Works)
