## My Rage
Quickly get overwhelmed by the kids barrage of request. 
People say I am mean but they have no idea how annoying they are collectively.  
It kind of burns when I say things out of good heart and they don't give a damn.  

Also mad at N's naive thoughts:  
  1.  I am supposed to treat every student equally.  
  2.  I am supposed to help the students.  
  3.  I am supposed to be nice to students. 
  
At the same time, I asked her multiple times to double-check her work but she just didn't believe in me  
until I showed her. Arguing with her is like arguing talking about curing cancer; I could have spent the  
time doing something more productive.  

Thinking about those negative moments really makes me super mad. One of the biggest dilemma of teaching is  
how to distribute your time and effort to your students. Some students you have to spend so much time and effort  
to help them unlearned the bs thoughts/learning practices that they have been having. And there are students that  
are more receptive, and learns fast according to your teaching. The latter could be just be so much better if I  
spend more time.  

What is my goal of teaching?  
For pleasure/so mental satisfication? For money? For solving problems most people don't even try to solve or can't  
solve? Or for re-gaining my learning skills? 

## Lessons  
1.I need to prioritize grading stuff if necessary.
2.This environment is pretty difficult for students to learn the concepts.(I was literally forcing Brandon to  
read the instructions/formulas because I don't have time to teach him the concepts. His teachers are probably not going  
to do so either.) I only have 4 hours, and I have to spend time grading and helping kids with problems so I am not Jesus.  
3.Sometimes when I project I will have to commit a long time to help students get to the answer. I just surrender.  

## Analysis  
### Brandon's Question: finding gcf and lcm  
I am forcing him to read the instructions of finding gcf and lcm.  
It is not perfect to understand the materials. But he is probably too lazy to read the instructions alone,  
lack of self-control. Also he may be disencouraged by not understanding the instructions because of his weak  
foundations.  

I should keep a list of teaching/tutoring problems/challenges I have. Then try to break them down one by one.  
already made a google doc for that.  

## What to Do
1.Need to work on teaching students how to use notebooks, one or two important guidelines would do the initial trick,  
I dont want to overdo it.  
2.Ask the Chinese girl to keep a journal.  
3.Beware when I am burning out/being too rude.
