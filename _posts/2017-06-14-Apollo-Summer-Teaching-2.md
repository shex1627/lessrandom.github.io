# Learning is trying to do something you cannot do.(deep practice)

**Phrases I use to teach kids**  
1.Come on, you could do this, just list all the multiples of twos, then you get your answer.  
2.You need to level up, you need to learn how to double check your work. 

**Failure of Retardation Technique**
1.L admits he is re******* for the answer to the question. Now I get to redirect his thinking into that 
he is just lazy and he could overcome this laziness. Not sure if that will work or not but I have to stop 
him from thinking that he is inherently retarded.

**Failure of the Work Place**  
### Constraints in Apollo  
1.I have no control over the curriculum  
2.kids have alternatives to ask "easy tutors for answers"  
**I need to apply for at least 20 other tutoring opportunities by next week** 

**Scoreboard**  
Since I have little control over anything, I find it difficult to create a scoreboard.  
Don't expect it is going to work, you need to be resonsive

### J's scoreboard:  
Tracking the "negatives" and "positives" in her language/action  
something like "I don't know", "I don't care" are negatives.  

### My scoreboard:  
**I have to learn how to articulate my opinions and defend my positions, dont get dominated**  
**keep in mind that try not to hurt the other person's self-esteem too much**  
Defend my position other tutors/Mr.Fong challenges me  
a)like if Mr.Fong forces L  to finish his package fast, I have to defend that he has  
to first learn to be smart frist, otherwise he is just going to get distracted all the  
time and ask other tutor for their answers.  

b)If other people argue that I am making things more complicated, I want to argue that  
They don't get smarter by knowing to answer, they have to understand why things work first.  

### E's scoreboard  
Should be related to number of problems that he figures out how to double check his answers.  
Questions he could find he is wrong by simply double-checking.
