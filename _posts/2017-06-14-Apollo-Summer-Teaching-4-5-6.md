# Day 4(Monday)  
### Challenges
1. more students  
Favoritism is acceptable but leaves much less time for others  
At least I know songxi needs more help because she is new  
Maybe restraining amount of time I help each student 30min each.  
2. still no notes on the learning/tutoring procedure because lack of specification  
 
#### My methodology:  
**Critical thinking focused:**  
1.wrong in understanding or wrong in math  
2.spend more time  
 
**Some effort to be nice, avoiding criticism:**  
(Lessons from How to Win Friends)  
1.you get to break your limits/level up,   
You want to learn to be smarter  
 
# Day 5(Tuesday)  
Feeling proud with my idea to measure time but it clearly needs more work.  
 
### Some problems:  
1.Still Amy and Andy keeps occupying most of my tutoring time.    
2.some times I have to read the question and solve the problem first.  

### Challenge:  
1.Need to help the new Chinese girl  
(Vs people bombarding me with questions)  
commiitng 30min after 315break helping her  
2.Check Easonâ€™s work, how he got things wrong  
3.I got really tired after 2 hours of work, I think the kids   
Are like that as well(trying to address it with snacks and health-related things like exercise, sleep well)  
 
perception debug(systematically reduce perception mistake such as how to work at big 4, fasten my learning process)  
  
####  To-Do:
Get some snacks for myself, co-workers and students I order of priority.  


# Day 6(Wednesday) 
Today is workload is much less since A was not there(one of the students that ask me lots of questions, 
occupy approximately 20-30% of my time. 
The data I have yesterday doesn't help much with the work today.  

S* ask me lots of questions today. These kind of random(uncertain) workflow makes optimization difficult. Next week
is we are separating the tutors into groups. I will be helping the algebra and geometry kids.  

I have made attempts to tak to the Chinese girl and giving out snacks. But they didn't work as what I previously intended. 
I need to keep working on my people/implementation skills. Just keep trying I will get better.  

### Good Attempt  
Teaching Andy problem solving skills - checking related topics(radiant thinking)  

## Important Realization  
I think I have somehow forgotten my philiosophy to teaching my students to appreciate math. 
Andy seems to get it but I am not sure about other students.  

Right now I am just slowly doing optimizating my work but have not commmitted significant efforts to carry out the 
difficult yet important work:  
1. Teaching my students to appreciate math  
2. Teach character strength 
3. Techh my students to be competitive, fundementally change them(from environment, to parents)  

Do keep in mind that I have tried to make progress on those, and failed miserably. Eat those failures and move forward.  
Things are not going to be easy. I can just bomb and solve the problem by one day's effort. 

Also, doing so require so much energy from me. On Friday I have to make sure I prioritize my work, focus on the students that
have high impacts. (or simply just surivive, it is too difficult to make changes to a person once per week)
